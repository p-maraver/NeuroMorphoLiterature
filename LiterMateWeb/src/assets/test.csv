The efficient in vivo visualization of blood vessels and the reliable quantification of their complexity are key to understanding the biology and disease of the vascular network. Here, we provide a detailed method to visualize blood vessels with a commercially available fluorescent dye, human plasma acetylated low density lipoprotein DiI complex (DiI-AcLDL), and to quantify their complexity in Xenopus tropicalis. Blood vessels can be labeled by a simple injection of DiI-AcLDL into the beating heart of an embryo, and blood vessels in the entire embryo can be imaged in live or fixed embryos. Combined with gene perturbation by the targeted microinjection of nucleic acids and/or the bath application of pharmacological reagents, the roles of a gene or of a signaling pathway on vascular development can be investigated within one week without resorting to sophisticated genetically engineered animals. Because of the well-defined venous system of Xenopus and its stereotypic angiogenesis, the sprouting of pre-existing vessels, vessel complexity can be quantified efficiently after perturbation experiments. This relatively simple protocol should serve as an easily accessible tool in diverse fields of cardiovascular research."

However, because of the failure of chemotherapeutic agents to cross the blood-brain barrier and the lack of response of some brain tumors to these agents, radiation therapy is still used to treat many childhood cancers with CNS involvement. In this study, we investigated the radiation effects on cognition and dendritic structure in the hippocampus in juvenile male mice. Twenty-one-day-old male C57BL/6 mice were irradiated using the small animal radiation research platform (SARRP). Animals were exposed to either a 10 Gy single dose or 10 Gy × 2 fractionated doses of X-ray cranial radiation. Five weeks after irradiation, animals were tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. Significant impairment in spatial memory retention was observed in the probe trial after the first day of hidden-platform training (first probe trial) in animals that received either 10 Gy single-dose or 10 Gy × 2 fractionated doses. However, by day 5, mice that received a 10 Gy single dose showed spatial memory retention in the probe trials, whereas mice that received the 20 Gy fractionated doses remained impaired. During Y-maze testing, animals exposed to radiation were impaired; the irradiated mice were not able to distinguish among the three Y-maze arms and spent approximately the same amount of time in all three arms during the retention trial. Radiation significantly compromised the dendritic architecture and reduced spine density throughout the hippocampal trisynaptic network."

The effectiveness in using embolic protection devices (EPDs), such as the Angioguard™ XP filter, during carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a topic of ongoing controversy and scrutiny. Early clinical results indicate that EPDs can reduce complications associated with CAS. However, the incidence of stroke and postprocedural embolic events are statistically similar when comparing CAS with the gold standard in carotid stenosis repair, carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The focus of this manuscript is the critical evaluation of Angioguard XP with respect to numerous in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and clinical trials that have been conducted by the authors and other researchers to investigate the efficacy of EPDs with the objective of suggesting engineering design considerations for future generations of these devices. Angioguard XP has had mixed performance outcomes in in vitro testing reported in the literature. In our laboratory, this device had undesirable measures of performance in bench-top testing protocols using in vitro flow models. Technical considerations relevant to design of EPDs, such as ideal pore size, effective wall apposition in tortuous geometry and maximization of capture efficiency have not been addressed adequately in the literature. It is likely that in the future both CAS and CEA will coexist as potential forms of treatment in the clinical management of cerebrovascular disease."

However, less is known about the role of Pax6 in the maintenance and differentiation of adult NSCs and in adult neurogenesis. Using the +/SeyDey mouse, we have analyzed how Pax6 heterozygosis influences the self-renewal and proliferation of adult olfactory bulb stem cells (aOBSCs). In addition, we assessed its influence on neural differentiation, neuronal incorporation, and cell death in the adult OB, both in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that the Pax6 mutation alters Nestin+-cell proliferation in vivo, as well as self-renewal, proliferation, and survival of aOBSCs in vitro although a subpopulation of +/SeyDey progenitors is able to expand partially similar to wild-type progenitors. This mutation also impairs aOBSC differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas it increases cell death while preserving astrocyte survival and differentiation. Furthermore, Pax6 heterozygosis causes a reduction in the variety of neurochemical interneuron subtypes generated from aOBSCs in vitro and in the incorporation of newly generated neurons into the OB in vivo. Our findings support an important role of Pax6 in the maintenance of aOBSCs by regulating cell death, self-renewal, and cell fate, as well as in neuronal incorporation into the adult OB. They also suggest that deregulation of the cell cycle machinery and TF expression in aOBSCs which are deficient in Pax6 may be at the origin of the phenotypes observed in this adult NSC population."

However, little is known about the interplay between these post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the same nonhistone residues. We have recently discovered that N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and N-terminal methyltransferases (NRMTs) can have overlapping substrates and identified myosin regulatory light chain 9 (MYL9) as the first confirmed protein to occur in either α-amino-methylated (Nα-methyl) or α-amino-acetylated (Nα-acetyl) states in vivo. Here we aim to determine if these PTMs function similarly or create different MYL9 proteoforms with distinct roles. We use enzymatic assays to directly verify MYL9 is a substrate of both NRMT1 and NatA and generate mutants of MYL9 that are exclusive for Nα-acetylation or Nα-methylation. We then employ eukaryotic cell models to probe the regulatory functions of these Nα-PTMs on MYL9. Our results show that, contrary to prevailing dogma, neither of these modifications regulate the stability of MYL9. Rather, exclusive Nα-acetylation promotes cytoplasmic roles of MYL9, while exclusive Nα-methylation promotes the nuclear role of MYL9 as a transcription factor. The increased cytoplasmic activity of Nα-acetylated MYL9 corresponds with increased phosphorylation at serine 19, a key MYL9 activating PTM. Increased nuclear activity of Nα-methylated MYL9 corresponds with increased DNA binding. Nα-methylation also results in a decrease of interactions between the N-terminus of MYL9 and a host of cytoskeletal proteins. These results confirm that Nα-acetylation and Nα-methylation differentially affect MYL9 function by creating distinct proteoforms with different internal PTM patterns and binding properties."

Fischer","Therapeutic increase of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is of great interest as BAT activation counteracts obesity and insulin resistance. Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan, found in the extracellular matrix, which is synthesized by HA synthases (Has1/Has2/Has3) from sugar precursors and accumulates in diabetic conditions. Its synthesis can be inhibited by the small molecule 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU). Here, we show that the inhibition of HA-synthesis by 4-MU or genetic deletion of Has2/Has3 improves BAT`s thermogenic capacity, reduces body weight gain, and improves glucose homeostasis independently from adrenergic stimulation in mice on diabetogenic diet, as shown by a magnetic resonance T2 mapping approach. Inhibition of HA synthesis increases glycolysis, BAT respiration and uncoupling protein 1 expression. In addition, we show that 4-MU increases BAT capacity without inducing chronic stimulation and propose that 4-MU, a clinically approved prescription-free drug, could be repurposed to treat obesity and diabetes."

Unlike canonical estrogen receptors, GPER activation is associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation; thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms through which GPER regulates hippocampal function may provide new avenues for the development of drugs that provide the cognitive benefits of estrogens without harmful side effects. Here, we demonstrate that GPER increases CA1 dendritic spine density and hippocampal memory consolidation in a manner dependent on actin polymerization and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. These findings provide novel insights into the role of GPER in mediating hippocampal morphology and memory consolidation, and may suggest first steps toward new therapeutics that more safely and effectively reduce memory decline in menopausal women."

Cutaneous manifestations include rash and eschar, which both occur at varying incidence depending on the infecting species. Serology is the mainstay of diagnosis, and the indirect immunofluorescence assay is the test of choice. Reactive antibodies are seldom present during early illness, so testing should be performed on both acute- and convalescent-phase sera. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice."

Research on modified fungal metabolites converged with basic science studies that had identified lysophospholipid (LP) sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, providing mechanistic insights on fingolimod while validating LP receptors as drug targets. Mechanism of action (MOA) studies identified receptor-mediated processes involving the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). These dual actions represent a more general theme for S1P and likely other LP receptor modulators. Fingolimod’s direct CNS activities likely contribute to its efficacy in MS, with particular relevance to treating progressive disease stages and forms that involve neurodegeneration. The evolving understanding of fingolimod’s MOA has provided strategies for developing next-generation compounds with superior attributes, suggesting new ways to target S1P as well as other LP receptor modulators for novel therapeutics in the CNS and other organ systems."
